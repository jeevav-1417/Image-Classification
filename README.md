# Image-Classification
This project is an Image Classification System using MobileNetV2 and a custom CIFAR-10 CNN. It includes a Streamlit app where users upload images, select models, and view predictions with confidence scores. MobileNetV2 handles diverse real-world images, while CIFAR-10 CNN classifies into 10 categories. Ideal for exploring AI workflows!
